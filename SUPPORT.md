## Before Opening an Issue

1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/totakit/sdk/issues) — someone may have already reported it
2. Check [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/totakit/discussions) — it might already be answered
3. Try a different browser — some tools use Web APIs that vary by browser
4. Clear your browser cache — stale service workers can cause issues
